Coding Invitation
-----------------

Write a 3D navigator resembling the original Wolfenstein 3D classic, as follows:
- Web app written in JavaScript
- Can only use the Line API on the canvas element, all 3D most be done via software by the programmer
- Handle keyboard arrows for navigation (UDLR)

  Starting point is the center of the first empty square on right-down scan.
  Example: Blue room
    ['blue','blue','blue','blue',
     'blue',''    ,''    ,'blue',
     'blue',''    ,''    ,'blue',
     'blue','blue','blue','blue']
